Some Profits of the Three Satoshis include:

### How Do I Help Bring About The Dump?

Health Rituals for bringing about the dumpening:
* **Juice Cleansing** - Buy inorganic fruits and vegetables from the market. Wash items for 2-4 hours until they turn into clumpy juice. Throw away without consuming and begin again. Repeat 4 times daily.
* **Fasting** - Go to pharmacy - preferable one with self checkout. Get on longest service line available and complain about speed of checkout. Demand to know why the line is not moving faster. Attempt to engage with customers in front of you.

### What Was The Recent "Fat Earth" Controversy All About?

While we do believe that our home planet has put on too much weight, we are offended by claims our critics are making that we are "Fat Earthers." We prefer more planet positve and appropriate names for our stance - such as "Hour Glass Earthers" or "Earth+"
